## Installation
```bash

```
or
```bash
pip3 install qa_genie
```


## Usage
```python
email = "your_email@example.com" # huggingface account email
password = "your_password" # huggingface account password
model = "meta" # use "meta" to use meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf or "oasst" to use OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b

# Initialize chatbot
chatbot = get_generator(email, password, model)

# Example usage with a single text
text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
result_single = extract_qa(chatbot, text, num_qn=3) # returns pandas.DataFrame with num_qn questions and answers

# Example usage with multiple texts
texts = ["Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3"]
result_multiple = extract_qas(chatbot, texts, num_qn_each=3) # return pandas.DataFrame with num_qn_each questions and answers generated for each text
```

## Important Note
As mentioned by [Soulter](github.com/Soulter), Server resources are precious, it is not recommended to request this API in a high frequency.
